# Data Management Project
This project showcases the design and implementation of a local company's database system, we kicked off by interviewing an IT solution provider to gather comprehensive insights into the business requirements and rules. With a clear understanding of the needs at hand, our next step was to design a relational database tailored to meet these requirements. We meticulously mapped out the database structure using Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), ensuring adherence to the normalization rules vital for efficient data organization. Following the design phase, we seamlessly implemented the database utilizing MySQL, a robust relational database management system. Once the database was up and running, we populated its tables with relevant data, significantly enhancing the store's data analytics capabilities. This streamlined approach to database design and implementation ensures optimal performance and scalability to support the store's operations effectively.
