## Project Overview:

This project showcases the design and implementation of a local company's database system. an IT solution provider was interviewed to gather comprehensive insights into the business requirements and rules. With a clear understanding of the needs at hand, the next step involved designing a relational database tailored to meet these requirements. The database structure was mapped out using Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), ensuring adherence to the normalization rules vital for efficient data organization. Following the design phase, the database was seamlessly implemented utilizing MySQL, a robust relational database management system. Once the database was up and running, its tables were populated with relevant data, significantly enhancing the store's data analytics capabilities.
